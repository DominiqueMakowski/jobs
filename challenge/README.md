# The "make sense out of some data" challenge

*Expected time to complete: 30min - 1h*

The goal of this challenge is to 1) expose you to some typical data that we work with and 2) see how you deal with new information. Indeed, there are no right nor wrong answers, no "trick" available. What's important to us is how you face a new challenge, and how you think about it. It doesn't matter what tools you use, and what results do you obtain, as long as we can follow your investigation(s).

## Description

The data is in the `data.csv` file. Several participants have watched pictures that are either **Negative** or **Neutral**. After each image, they had to judge the **Intensity** of the emotion that they felt and the **Self-Relevance** (i.e., how much the content of the picture was "personally relevant" to them).


## Questions

Your mission is to explore this dataset and make some statistical conclusions (in order words, to say something about that data). Here are some questions to guide you:

1. Describe the dataset (how many participants, how many items, average ratings, etc.)
2. Is there any difference between Negative and Neutral stimuli in terms of intensity and self-relevance?
3. What's the relationship between intensity and self-relevance?

We expect you to submit one document (can be word, pdf, html, whatever format) containing your report. It can include text, formulas, code, figures, memes, gifs, whatever you need to explain how you've proceeded, and what you found.

Good luck, and have fun :relaxed:
