### Companion <sub><sup>(open)</sup></sub>

During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, becoming a master craftsman required to undertake a long journey that would bring the novice to gain the rank of master through *"companionship"*. As such, the learner would learn from a teacher for a given period of time, after what he or she would move on to a new adventure.

You're a student, or a researcher-in-training, and you feel like you have time (and energy âš¡) to learn more? And you also would like to learn new skills by contributing to open-science? But you would also like this training to result in something academically valuable (like a publication)? In other words, **you want it all**? 

Good news, as I might have something of interest for you. Indeed, as I'm invested in quite a lot of open-access projects, I know many topics and areas in which there is a need for a contributor on your freetime (and not at the expense of your main objectives, don't drop school for that!). Depending on your current skills - but most importantly the skills you want to developp, you can check-out the list below to see if there is any issue or topic that could itnerest you. If that's the case, then contact us: we will provde you with assistance, guidance and help so you can start working at your rythm in a comfortable environment.


- [ ] The Structure of Indices of Heart Rate Variability (HRV). We have a [draft](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studies/hrv_structure.html) of a study that we'd like to improve. The goal is to use existing dataset to investigate the structure (using factor analysis and/or clustering) of HRV indices, to understand their nature and derive guidelines for their reporting. **Main skills to developp**: R, statistics, knowledge of ECG / HRV.
