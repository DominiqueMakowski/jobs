During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, becoming a master craftsman required to undertake a long journey that would bring the novice to gain the rank of master through *"companionship"*. As such, the learner would learn from a teacher for a given period of time, after what she or he would decide to leave and move on to a new adventure.

You're a student or a researcher-in-training, and **you feel like you have time** *(and energy âš¡)* **to learn more?** And you also would like to **learn new skills** and contribute to open-science? But you would also like this training to result in something academically valuable (like a publication)? In other words, **you want it all**?

Good news, I might have something of interest for you. Being in touch with several open-access projects, I know some topics and areas in which there is a need for contributors, with different projects just waiting for some brilliant mind to push it forward. Some interesting stuff that you can investigate on your free time (but not at the expense of your main objectives, i.e., **don't drop school for that!**). Depending on your current skills - **but most importantly the skills you want to develop** - you can check-out the list below to see if there is anything that could be of interest to you. If that's the case, do contact us; we will provide you with assistance, guidance and help so you can start exploring it at your rhythm in a comfortable environment :)


- [ ] **An GAM-based Approach to EEG/ERP Analysis**. General Additive Models (GAM) are a powerful class of regression models that seem very appropriate to model ERP data. We have a [draft](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studies/erp_gam.html) of a study that aims to be like a tutorial / guide to analyze ERP using GAMs.
    - *Skills that you will improve*: Python (MNE), R, ERP/EEG, GAMs.

- [ ] **Deep learning model for ECG delineation**. Train, validate and make available (in [NeuroKit](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit)) a model able to locate the different components of ECG signals (the different peaks, waves, etc.). Some work has already be done ([1](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/issues/89#issuecomment-653834058)) it seems, so that we can have a basis on which improve such tool and make accessible.
    - *Skills that you will improve*: Python, deep learning, ECG.

- [ ] **Benchmarking of ECG Preprocessing Methods**. I really makes me crazy to see how there is no consensus nor guidelines on how to preprocess physiological signals. Time do remedy to that. We have a [draft](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studies/ecg_preprocessing.html) of a study that aims at comparing different preprocessing methods to outline the best processing workflow.
    - *Skills that you will improve*: Python, signal processing, ECG.

- [ ] **EOG events templates**. We have a [draft](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studies/eog_blinktemplate.html) of a study that aims at describing the different events in EOG signals (blinks, saccades, ...) and try to create their statistical templates.
    - *Skills that you will improve*: Python, signal processing, EOG.

- [ ] **The report package**. The [**report**](https://github.com/easystats/report) package is the pinnacle of the **easystats** project, and one of its most demanded and used component. Unfortunately, it is a bit stuck at the moment and it would benefit from some fresh perspective on it. Are you up for the challenge?
    - *Skills that you will improve*: R, statistics, methodological best practices.

- [ ] **The Structure of Indices of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**. We have a [draft](https://neurokit2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studies/hrv_structure.html) of a study that we'd like to improve. The goal is to use existing dataset to investigate the structure (using factor analysis and/or clustering) of HRV indices, to understand their nature and derive guidelines for their reporting.
    - *Skills that you will improve*: R, statistics (factor analysis, clustering), knowledge of ECG / HRV, paper writing.

*Note that the amount of engagement and time you want to devote to such side-project is entirely up to you. As it is 100% based on self-engagement, we won't ask for any target goals, so no pressure. Joining our network and working on these things should always be interesting, useful to you, and fun.*

### ~Research Assistant/Associate~ <sub><sup>(posted 20/08/2020)</sup></sub>

We're looking for a **research assistant/associate** (bachelor or master degree) to come over to Singapore for 2 years and work with us on [**reality bending**](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/research/) ([click-here](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/research/) to learn more about what we do).

- **Salary**: SGD 2800-3400/month <sub><sup>*(not including bonuses)*</sup></sub>
- **Where**: Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
- **When**: As soon as possible
- **How long**: max. 2 years
- **With whom**: With the [**ReBeL**](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/research/#people) team (part of the [Clinical Brain Lab](http://www.clinicalbrain.org/))
- **To do what**: Running experiments, analyzing data, writing papers
- **Contact**: dom.makowski@gmail.com
- **Requirements**: being smart, curious, ambitious, proficient and cool. Also, experience with Python and/or R will help a lot
- **Skills to developp**: Python, R, signal processing, experiment crafting, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, writing, presenting, pizza testing, ...
- **Application deadline**: This position will be closed once the right candidate is found.

**Context**

I recently obtained a grant for 2 years to investigate the neural mechanisms that lead to the belief that something is real or not (like fake news) and investigate possible ways of modulating this belief (by manipulating the external and internal context, and stimulating the brain).

We plan to run several experiments including techniques like EEG, bodily signals, and possibly neurofeedback and brain stimulation (TDCs) with different populations (healthy young adults, older adults and psychiatric patients).


**How to apply**:

- [ ] Drop me an **email** (with a **CV**) in which you tell us why you're the best candidate for the job. You can mention whom you've work with, but focus on what you actually did, learned, what you liked and didn't like, and what you want to learn and do in the future.

- [ ] **Challenge**: If you want, you can try and do the ["make sense out of some data" challenge](https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/jobs/tree/master/challenge) (you can attach your report alongside your CV in the email). Remember, it's not about getting the right answer, but rather about trying and thinking.


**About the university**

The Nanyang <sub><sup>(*which means "Southeast Asia" in Chinese*)</sup></sub> Technological University (NTU) is one of the two main universities in Singapore. Although relatively young compared to most of western institutes, NTU is a dynamic and vibrant university that has quickly achieved an international leadership in many areas. NTU has been ranked as 1st in the ranking of young universities in the QS World University Rankings since 2015, and is considered as a top-tier research institution in Asia.
Aside from its academic qualities, NTU is known for its green campus (NTU has been listed as one of the world's most beautiful universities) and its architectural landmarks, making it an ideal location to foster a positive growth mindset.
